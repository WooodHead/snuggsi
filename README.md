Browser component extensions.

https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom

_Why?_ We don't need _(yet)_ another framework.
We need _"syntactic sugar"_ around new spec driven browser features.
Consider them _"DOM Extensions"_ as you are always interacting with
Living DOM nodes. This gives you the ability to gradually incorporate
these extensions into your existing code! Best of all,
works in your browser today! _for the most part_. And if the feature doesn't,
it will in the immediate future without you having to "update" anything. The
browsers are working dilligently abiding by the specs. Therefore not only can
we use the features today, this `README` alone will better acclaimate you to
*modern browser development using javascript*.

## Syntactic DOM "Sugar"

### [Text](/elements/text.js)

`bind`ing for `textContent` mutations between two `Nodes`.
`Text` nodes are portable and can be used freely throughout code.
Best use case is when you need to keep track of element changes
without touching the DOM, or worse causing a reflow / repaint _(i.e. `appendChild()`, `.innerText`, `.innerHTML`)_

#### Must Know
  - `Text` - https://github.com/snuggs/snuggsi#text-1
  - `Node.textContent` - https://github.com/snuggs/snuggsi#nodetextcontent
  - `Document.querySelector ()` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector

Copy & pasta dependency from the following link into developer console.

_‚úÖ  No worries! No foolishness here !_
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snuggs/snuggsi/master/elements/text.js

_[Console](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools#console) example snippet_
```Javascript
const name = new Text ('devPunks')
name.textContent // "devPunks"

const h1 = document.querySelector ('h1')
h1.textContent  // "Default Header"

// now let's bind text to a DOM node
// Text node takes precedence over element contents
name.bind (h1)
h1.textContent  // "devPunks"
name.textContent === h1.textContent // true

// now let's update the DOM node
// (which will implicitly update `Text` node)
h1.textContent = 'So RAD!'
name.textContent  // "So RAD!"
name.textContent === h1.textContent // true

// 2 way text content binding!
```

### [State](/state.js)

How to manage state over time.

### [Attribute](/elements/attribute.js)
Living Standard ([Web IDL](/elements/attribute.idl))

Attribute binding relay

### [Attributes](/elements/attributes.js)

Attributes named node map.

### [Template](/elements/template.js)

`<template>` to `DocumentFragment` element renderer.

## Testing
"Update April 2016: since writing this post, I've moved to using tap which spawns individual processes for each test file, so I don't need this approach at all now."

### Modern DOM Interfaces
The following are the minimum set of *modern* DOM APIs
you should be familiar with today. Each API has a `console`
example snippet. Just copy / pasta the examples into the
developer console and _"It just works!" ‚Ñ¢_

#### CSS Selectors
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors

#### Template Literals
Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions
_([string interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation))_.
As you may have noticed the [Grave accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent) _(``)_
is used instead of double/single quotes.
You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.
They were called "template strings" in prior editions of the ES2015 specification.
```Javascript
`Hello !`

`Line one of text
 Line two (with preserved \n`

const greeting = 'world'
`Hello ${greeting} !`

tag `string text ${greeting} string text`
```

#### Templates
The *HTML _<template>_* element is a mechanism for holding client-side content
that is not to be rendered when a page is loaded but may subsequently
be instantiated during runtime using JavaScript. 

Think of a template as a content fragment that is being stored for subsequent use in the document.
While the parser does process the contents of the <template> element while loading the page,
it does so only to ensure that those contents are valid; the element's contents are not rendered, however.

#### Text
The Text interface represents the textual content of Element or Attr.  If an element has no markup within its content, it has a single child implementing Text that contains the element's text.  However, if the element contains markup, it is parsed into information items and Text nodes that form its children.

const full  = new Text ('Yo! üëä')

empty.textContent // ""

#### DocumentFragment
AKA _"How did 'front-end frameworks' miss this?"_

The DocumentFragment has been proven to be the fastest method of updating DOM Tree.
The implementation was spec'd all the way back in DOM Level 1. We should be using this today!

#### Document.querySelector
Returns the first Element within the document
(using depth-first pre-order traversal of the document's nodes
by first element in document markup and iterating through sequential
nodes by order of amount of child nodes) that matches the specified group of selectors.

_[Console](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools#console) example snippet_
```Javascript
// Select the <head> element
const head = document.querySelector ('head')
console.log (head)

// Select the <body> element
const body = document.querySelector ('body')
console.log (body)

// Returns the first `<h1>`
const h1 = document.querySelector ('h1')
console.log (h1)

// Returns the *first* HTMLElement with the `id` of `foo`
// (See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/id)
const foo = document.querySelector ('#foo')
console.log (foo)

// Returns the *first* HTMLElement with `posts` within its `classList`
// (See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)

#### Rendering (Re-Flow, Re-Layout, Re-Paint)

https://www.phpied.com/rendering-repaint-reflowrelayout-restyle

![Rendering (Layout, Reflow, Repaint, & Redraw)](http://www.phpied.com/files/reflow/render.png)

* render tree - the visual part of the DOM tree
* nodes in the render tree are called frames or boxes
* recalculating parts of the render tree is called reflow (in Mozilla), and called layout in every other browser, it seems
* Updating the screen with the results of the recalculated render tree is called repaint, or redraw (in IE/DynaTrace)
* SpeedTracer introduces the notion of "style recalculation" (styles without geometry changes) vs. "layout"

### Notes
Taken from [SASSC-ruby](https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby)
  - http://blog.sass-lang.com/posts/1022316-announcing-dart-sass

warning: "Ruby Sass, on the other hand, will eventually go away unless a new maintainer appears. We don't want to make the transition sudden and risk fracturing the ecosystem: Chris and I are committed to maintaining it for one year, which includes keeping the language in sync with any new additions in Dart Sass. If anyone is interested in volunteering as a maintainer after that period, we'd be thrilled to mentor them and teach them the codebase over the coming year. But if no one steps up, Ruby Sass will be officially considered deprecated and unmaintained.

I want to emphasize that we aren't making the decision to stop developing Ruby Sass lightly. This is a big change, and it's not an easy one for me‚ÄîI've worked on Ruby Sass continuously for almost ten years now, and it's difficult to let that history go. But Chris and I have discussed this thoroughly, and we're convinced this is the right move. We only have so much time to devote to Sass, and it no longer makes sense to put that time into an implementation that's so slow as to be infeasible for many of our largest users."

#### Why a Rack skeleton server ?
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4517021
"Rails" is a collection of libraries and conventions, just as "Sinatra + ActiveRecord" is. There's nothing inherent in it that makes it "worse" than Sinatra (which I love, by the way) for JSON APIs.

Use Rack, pick your favorite gems, and go to town. Why mess with all the other Sinatra junk when you can have a simple config.ru for your app and just write a simple call method and you're good to go?

You don't need all the ceremony and structure of Sinatra to write a JSON API, you just don't.

#### Deployment to Heroku
https://github.com/sass/sassc-rails

Due to LibSass compilation requirements, you must upgrade to the
[Heroku Cedar-14 Stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar-14-migration)
in order to successfully install this gem.

Upgrading to Cedar-14 is usually a painless process.
