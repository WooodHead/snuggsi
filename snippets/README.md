Snippets are small scripts that you can author and execute within the Sources panel of Chrome DevTools. You can access and run them from any page. When you run a snippet, it executes from the context of the currently open page.


If you have small utilities or debugging scripts which you find yourself using repeatedly on multiple pages, consider saving the scripts as snippets. You can also use snippets as an alternative to bookmarklets.

## TL;DR

  - Snippets are small scripts that you can run from any page (similar to bookmarklets).
  - Run portions of snippets in the Console with the "Evaluate in Console" feature.
  - Remember that popular features from the Sources panel, like breakpoints, also work with snippets.
